# Detecting-Duplicate-Images-using-CelebA-Dataset

In this project we detect duplicate images and we train our network using CelebA dataset. We use a convolutional autoencoder as our model. 
You can download the celebA dataset by executing the following command from the terminal window:
python download.py celebA

## The repository includes the encodings for the training images as well as the weights of the model. So there should not be a need to train the model again. But you may train it once again if you would like to.
